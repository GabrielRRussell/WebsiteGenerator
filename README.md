# WebsiteGenerator
Generate Random Websites with Python

# Use

To use, simply run WebGenerator.py, and open a text file. The text file is a word list, separated by Line Breaks, or Spaces. The program will take each word, and place it in a list of possible words to use. I've supplied words.txt as a pre-provided solution. You can use any custom set of words you'd please.

To generate a website, click the generate button. This seeds a random page, and loads it. Clicking save will prompt for a file to save the output to, which can be opened by a web browser.
